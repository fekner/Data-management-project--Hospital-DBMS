# 1 Introduction

Well-designed hospital databases are important for the collection of patient information and achieving efficiency due to the processing of data, thus giving the healthcare provider relevant information. The data will require a structured ordering and a level of manipulation to make it easier to use. Healthcare database management systems are a best way to monitor and improve the value of the healthcare services and the well-being of the patients, which can be achieved by making information available on access to the appropriateness, effectiveness and quality of healthcare services and providers. The database system created in this project should be able to query basic information about the hospital employees such as doctor ID number, name, address, and phone number, query information about departments and patient assignments for each employee and store patient information for use by employees, such as patient ID, name, location, assigned doctor, prescriptions, and medical records to generate reports. 


## 1.1 User requirements 

User requirements encompass the essential needs of individuals and the tasks they aim to accomplish upon the completion of a database. Essentially, it involves outlining the functionalities users can execute within the database management system. In the context of this hospital database, the users are the staff, and the subsequent list outlines specific tasks to be carried out by the hospital's staff.

* Patient registration
* Patient check out
* Generation of patient information reports
* Storage of mandatory patient information
* Updating patient information

## 1.2 Non-functional requirements

Non-functional requirements help in understanding how the database system should behave. Below are some of the most important non-functional requirements for the hospital database.

* __Security:__ Ensuring security is paramount for a hospital database, preventing unauthorized alterations to the information. This involves setting appropriate permissions or administrative rights, limiting data modification access to hospital staff exclusively.
* __Performance:__ The system's response time for creating/changing records should be swift, and the database system must operate seamlessly without causing any slowdown.
* __Maintainability:__ In a hospital database, having reliable backup mechanisms is imperative due to the constant influx of patients and the busy nature of the environment.
* __Reliability:__ The hospital database system should maintain constant availability, ensuring uninterrupted access at all times.


## 1.3 Operational regulations

Operational regulations outline the organizational guidelines that govern the management of information within a company's database. They articulate the perspective of the business on the utilization of its data. The designated business rules for the hospital database include, but are not limited to the following.

* Null values are not allowed in the date columns.
* Each doctor will be allocated a distinct identification number.
* The departments are categorized based on medical requirements.
* Each doctor is exclusively assigned to one department.
* A doctor is permitted to be assigned to multiple patients.
* Patients have the option to schedule appointments with doctors.
* When required, patients can be admitted to the hospital.
* Patients may receive prescribed medication when deemed necessary.


# 2 Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

An entity-relationship diagram serves as a visual representation of the entities and their relationships within the database structure. Its primary objective is to offer a simplified conceptual overview of the intricate database design. Each entity in the diagram collects and stores data, while the relationships illustrate the connections between the data. In the Hospital network's ERD, the foundational table is Patients, followed by Doctors and Departments. This then branches into Appointments, ultimately connecting to Medical records through Prescriptions. The Patient table further extends its connections, branching into Stay and Care plans.
